==========================================================================================================================================
FRONT END:-We are creating a webpage for goverment.
when farmer came to a dealer for selling a crop,and when this crop is sold to a dealer then it is mandatory for dealer to give proper bill and billing is done on our websites.
All the details of purchase is stored and when dealer forward that crop to someone else ,then again billing is done on our website.
In this way whole process of transfer of crop can be recorded and when scarcity of crop in market is observed then we can directly backtrace our database and track the location of crop.And if it is found that someone purchase the crop and didn't forward it .then he is found guilty for storing the product because he wanted to sell that product in black to have more profit.
=========================================================================================================================================
Back end:

we are using here a blockchain technology to store the data so that it can not modified or deleted .we can only see the data in this changement in database is not possible .which result in full transparency and reduce corruption in india.
Here this seaching can be done by using farmer and dealer id .
=========================================================================================================================================
USES:
Our database contains crop purchasal rate and crop selling rate so farmer can also see that ,they are getting right price for their product or not.
it is useful for development of farmer and also for goverment to stop blackmarketing .
